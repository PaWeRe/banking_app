# Some pointers from Glassdoor 
## Banking app in Codesignal (4 step process)
- 1st tier: record and hold transactions (deposits and withdrawals)
- 2nd tier: do data metrics, returning the top k accounts with outgoing money
- 3rd tier: add scheduled transactions and cancelling them
- 4th tier: merge two accounts while maintaining separate account histories   

## Some generic advice
- Code a banking system with several parts of different criteria. Object oriented. One gotcha was returning n accounts with most total transactions (deposits and withdrawls), need an algo for ranking system. Part 3 was hard. Make sure transfer is accepted before doing funds transfer.
- Look at Codesignal's general coding framework or industrial coding framework doc.
